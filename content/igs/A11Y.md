<!-- 
Accessibility is becoming increasingly important in the publishing industry. Thanks to the opportunities offered by new standards and digital reading technologies a new paradigm is emerging: produce accessible publications and distribute them through traditional distribution channels, so that people with print disabilities can enjoy reading and benefit from the same opportunities and choice as any other reader.

New European and international legislative frameworks are reinforcing the demand for accessible content, not only by encouraging the production of digital accessible books, but also by requiring that the whole value chain (retailers, e-commerce sites, hardware and software, online platforms, DRM solutions, etc.) embrace accessibility. In particular, the recently approved European Accessibility Act invites the entire digital publishing industry to become accessible to disabled and elderly people.

There are already several interest groups working on the implementation of the EU Accessibility Act, but the constitution of the EDRLab membership and the technical expertise of the EDRLab team paves the way for interesting studies on specific topics. -->
