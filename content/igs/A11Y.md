The SDG Publishers Compact, developed by the UN and the IPA, features 10 action points that publishers, publishing associations and others can commit to undertaking in order to accelerate progress to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

EDRLab signed the compact in early 2023, the SDG Interest group is open to any EDRLab member who signed or want to sign the SDG Publishers Compact.
